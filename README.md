## Build an AI-Enabled FinTech B2B Invoice Management Application.
# Business Overview
## Introduction to B2B Operations:
The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Businesses work with other businesses on credit. 
When a buyer business orders goods from the seller business, the seller business issues an invoice for the same. 
This invoice for the goods contains various information like the details of the goods purchased and when it should be paid. 
This is known in accounting terminology as “Accounts Receivable”.
“Accounts Receivable represents money owed by entities to the firm on the sale of products or services on credit.
In most business entities, accounts receivable is typically executed by generating an invoice and either mailing or electronically delivering it to the customer, who, in turn, must pay it within an established timeframe, called credit terms or payment terms.”
Credit Check Department:
1.When a client receives an order, he validates the customer.
2.Then the client proceeds with verifying the available credit limit of the customer.
3.Once the credit limit gets verified, the client proceeds to check the purchase order sent to him by the customer.
●Collecting purchase order from customers for inventory check
